<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the holidays look different for everyone this year for one obvious reason, but many of you (or maybe someone you know) are also experiencing your first holiday season after the loss of a loved one. This is hard, but having been there too, I encourage you not to dwell on the empty chair at the dinner table. Watch the short video below for how you might be able to shed some positivity on the situation instead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently attended a virtual women’s business networking group meeting where the special guest speaker was a life and productivity coach. The theme of the meeting was <strong>“Promoting Gratitude and Joy” </strong>and during the meeting, the speaker asked us to consider what we’re grateful for. Not only to think about the cumulative things in our life that we’re grateful for but also the smaller things that may have happened just that day, in the last hour or even last few minutes. </p>



<p>I’m not going to lie, for the first time in a long time I really took the time to consider gratitude. After all, 2020 has been a dumpster fire of a year. However, I was able to muster up a pretty good list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m tremendously grateful for my husband, two beautiful, healthy kids, a home, clean water, and indoor plumbing. You know, the basics. I’m grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to start this business, that I have people who have supported me along the way. I’m also grateful for the experiences, although not pleasant, that has led me to desire to help others in many of the situations I’ve encountered.</p>



<p>Although you may be grateful for some of the same things I mentioned above, you also may have experienced the loss of a loved one this year and are trying to turn that grief into gratitude for the time you had with them.&nbsp;<strong>Trust me when I say I know that this can be extremely hard to do.</strong></p>



<p>In between your search for gratitude, you may be stuck, you may be deep in brain fog, you may have no idea where to start. So as you walk that path to finding gratitude, Let me turn my personal experiences with grief, loss, and everything those come with into individualized assistance that will be a guiding light to your own gratitude. It all starts with a simple, no-strings-attached phone call.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s my wish for you to find gratitude in even the smallest of places this year, and it would be an honor to help you find one more thing to be grateful for.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>People often wonder why I chose Black Dress Consultants as a name for my business. Besides the obvious reasons that people wear black to funerals, there’s a bit more to the story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a research librarian and self-described historian, my mother was an expert on the practice of Victorian mourning in 19th century America. She worked as a docent at Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta dressed to the nines in her time period black hoop skirt, veil, blouse, shoes, and more. In this picture, she is dressed as a Civil War widow in the first stage of mourning. My sister and I would frequently be embarrassed to be seen with her dressed like that and do rock-paper-scissors to see whose turn it was to drop mom off at the cemetery. Yet, it&#8217;s what she loved and what she was good at.</p>



<p>My mother&#8217;s passing was one of several life experiences that contributed to my founding of this company, so it was only appropriate that I honor her memory and her favorite pastime by referencing that very Black Dress in my business name. A few modern touches here and there to the brand image and there you have it &#8211; Black Dress Consultants was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I founded this company with one thing in mind: making end-of-life transitions easier.&nbsp;If you or someone you know is thinking of planning ahead and getting affairs in order in advance, or if&nbsp;you or someone you know recently lost a loved one and have no idea where to start with what they left behind, we&#8217;re here to help and we&#8217;re ready to chat when you are. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/blackdress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schedule a free consult</a>&nbsp;&#8211; absolutely no obligations or strings attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recorded a little message for you below, which I hope will not only offer you an interesting and digestible perspective on how not to treat dinner guests, but also as to why it&#8217;s important to think about your future. If not for you, but for your family. Take a moment to think about my message and know that I&#8217;m here when or if you&#8217;re ready to talk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to think about life as we know it very differently. We’re spending a lot of time at home, in pajamas, juggling work and/or home-schooling, attempting to keep a sourdough starter alive or planning about the perfect cross-country RV trip, all while trying to stay safe and healthy.  </p>



<p>The pandemic has also forced many of us to think about our own mortality and end-of-life decisions. A recent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/boom-time-for-death-planning.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>, “Boom Time for Death Planning”, spotlights how the pandemic has drawn new business to start-ups that provide end-of-life services. While it’s exciting to be launching a new business during this societal trend, I want to reiterate my personal reasons for joining this industry, which is to provide families with personalized solutions for life transitions so that they have the room to breathe and space to grieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While COVID-19 has prompted Americans to think more seriously about what they should be doing in case they were to get seriously ill or die, many have issues turning that thought into action. Did you know that an incredible 95% of adults want help putting their final plans and paperwork in order, but many aren’t sure how to start or who to ask? Well look no further if you’re looking to turn this “to do” into a “done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">A few days after my mother died, I found a box containing a special gravestone medallion with a sticky note stuck to it. Immediately recognizing her handwriting, I heard her voice in my head. I laughed, cried and shook my head simultaneously. This was so my mother.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Over the months and years that followed, I found random notes and pieces of paper that I used to piece together my mother’s end-of-life wishes.This was no easy task and there were many times I just didn’t know what to do when faced with the many decisions in front of me. To complicate matters further, my mother’s passing left me in charge of her brother’s care, who was in the latter years of advanced Parkinson’s Disease. I was left with no space to grieve as I was sandwiched in between taking care of my own family, working, handling my mother’s estate and taking on financial, legal and medical responsibilities for my uncle.&nbsp;<br><br>Now looking back, I wished I had been given some sort of a road map, a how-to or an instruction manual for estate planning, dying and everything in between.

<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignright columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-742x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="572" data-full-url="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article.jpg" data-link="/champion-article/" class="wp-image-572" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-742x1024.jpg 742w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-217x300.jpg 217w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-768x1060.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-1113x1536.jpg 1113w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-106x146.jpg 106w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-36x50.jpg 36w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article-54x75.jpg 54w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champion-article.jpg 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Rachel Donnelly went through a rough period during which she lost one after another of people dear to her; she now says she values what she learned during that time. “When I was 16, my father passed away at the age of 48. A few years later, we moved my grandmother to an assisted living home, where she passed shortly thereafter,” Donnelly recalled. “Several years later, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away. My mother’s passing left me with five houses to clean out and sell, as well as assuming her role as caregiver for my uncle, who was in the late stages of Parkinson’s disease. Last fall, my uncle passed away and I assumed the role of co-executrix of his estate. Some days I’ve felt like a real-life Little Orphan Annie whose life should be subtitled ‘Death Becomes Her.’”</p>



<p>Each time, she realized that in the midst of grief, there is a lot to be done—a memorial to be planned, belongings to be disposed of, insurance forms to be filed, death certificate applications to be completed, notifications to be sent to organizations the deceased was associated with, a will to be executed, and often much more. Donnelly founded her Decatur-based business, Black Dress Consultants, LLC, to help families through the administrative side of death. “We can take tasks off your plate, so you have space to grieve,” she said. “Our mission is to serve families as an ally for legacy planning and as a guide for navigating end-of-life decisions.”</p>
