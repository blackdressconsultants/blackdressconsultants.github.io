<p class="has-text-align-left">A few days after my mother died, I found a box containing a special gravestone medallion with a sticky note stuck to it. Immediately recognizing her handwriting, I heard her voice in my head. I laughed, cried and shook my head simultaneously. This was so my mother.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Over the months and years that followed, I found random notes and pieces of paper that I used to piece together my mother’s end-of-life wishes.This was no easy task and there were many times I just didn’t know what to do when faced with the many decisions in front of me. To complicate matters further, my mother’s passing left me in charge of her brother’s care, who was in the latter years of advanced Parkinson’s Disease. I was left with no space to grieve as I was sandwiched in between taking care of my own family, working, handling my mother’s estate and taking on financial, legal and medical responsibilities for my uncle.&nbsp;<br><br>Now looking back, I wished I had been given some sort of a road map, a how-to or an instruction manual for estate planning, dying and everything in between.

<p>Rachel Donnelly went through a rough period during which she lost one after another of people dear to her; she now says she values what she learned during that time. “When I was 16, my father passed away at the age of 48. A few years later, we moved my grandmother to an assisted living home, where she passed shortly thereafter,” Donnelly recalled. “Several years later, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away. My mother’s passing left me with five houses to clean out and sell, as well as assuming her role as caregiver for my uncle, who was in the late stages of Parkinson’s disease. Last fall, my uncle passed away and I assumed the role of co-executrix of his estate. Some days I’ve felt like a real-life Little Orphan Annie whose life should be subtitled ‘Death Becomes Her.’”</p>



<p>Each time, she realized that in the midst of grief, there is a lot to be done—a memorial to be planned, belongings to be disposed of, insurance forms to be filed, death certificate applications to be completed, notifications to be sent to organizations the deceased was associated with, a will to be executed, and often much more. Donnelly founded her Decatur-based business, Black Dress Consultants, LLC, to help families through the administrative side of death. “We can take tasks off your plate, so you have space to grieve,” she said. “Our mission is to serve families as an ally for legacy planning and as a guide for navigating end-of-life decisions.”</p>
