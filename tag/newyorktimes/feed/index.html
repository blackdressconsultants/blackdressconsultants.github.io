<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to think about life as we know it very differently. We’re spending a lot of time at home, in pajamas, juggling work and/or home-schooling, attempting to keep a sourdough starter alive or planning about the perfect cross-country RV trip, all while trying to stay safe and healthy.  </p>



<p>The pandemic has also forced many of us to think about our own mortality and end-of-life decisions. A recent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/boom-time-for-death-planning.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>, “Boom Time for Death Planning”, spotlights how the pandemic has drawn new business to start-ups that provide end-of-life services.

Did you know that an incredible 95% of adults want help putting their final plans and paperwork in order, but many aren’t sure how to start or who to ask? Well look no further if you’re looking to turn this “to do” into a “done.&nbsp;</p>
